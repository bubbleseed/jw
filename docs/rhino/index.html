          <p class="lead"><img src="/rhino/rian.jpg" style="float:left; width: 30%; padding-right: 20px; padding-left: 20px;">Hello, my name is Rian and I am a Javan rhino. I am also an orphan, because my mother and father died of disease. I am currently living in Ujung Kulon national park which is located in Indonesia. Right now, we are luckily being protected from poachers. I am happy here, because I have friends and a safe area. But us Javan rhinos are still in trouble, because there are not many of us left in the world – just me and 67 others!</p>
<p class="lead"><strong>Please help save us by <a href="https://rhinos.org/give/">donating</a>. Just a small sum of money could help us a lot. A donation of $20 can help to buy medicine and food for an orphan like me.</strong></p>

        <h2>Information</h2>
          <p>Long ago, many Javan rhinos lived in tropical forests all around Asia and Eastern India, in many countries. But the situation we are presented with today is drastically different. They are now the most critically endangered rhinos in the world. There are roughly 60 Javan rhinos left in the wild, none of which live in captivity as they all live in Ujung Kulon national park in Indonesia. The rhinos are in this situation mainly from poaching, because of their majestic horn (which only the males have). Their horns have been used for ornamental carvings and traditional medicines. The last Javan rhino in the wild was found with shot wounds and his horn removed back in 2010.</p>

          <h2>You can make a difference</h1>
          <p>The International Rhino Foundation has been working hard on conserving the Javan rhinos for over a decade. They help the rhinos by patrolling their living area and making sure that there are no poachers. The foundation is also trying their hardest to increase the habitat so the population can grow. They are currently raising funds to remove vegetation to increase the rhino’s habitat.</p>
